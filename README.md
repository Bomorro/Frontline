ACEM exam information
This webpage was created out of frustration. After passing the CICM fellowship with no issues with help from Deranged Physiology, I failed the ACEM fellowship written by 0.5%. Deranged Physiology was my inspiration for this and I'm hoping that I can put all the exam material in one place to give back to the trainees who are going through this exam.
